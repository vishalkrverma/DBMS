# SQL Reference Guide

A **database** is a collection of data stored in a format that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software system used to manage and manipulate data in databases.

A **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)** stores information in the form of **tables**.

- Example: `classicmodels.employees` ‚Üí `classicmodels` is the database, `employees` is the table.

| Feature | SQL (Relational) | NoSQL (Non-Relational) |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| Scalability | Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |

## üü¶ SELECT Statements

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT [column1, column2] FROM table_name;

üü© SELECT Clause with Alias
SELECT MRP AS "Selling Price";
SELECT (MRP * 0.90 + 1) AS "Discount Price";


üü® WHERE Clause

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status != 'shipped';
-- or use <>

üü• Logical Operators
SELECT * 
FROM payments 
WHERE NOT (amount >= 40000 AND amount <= 50000);

SELECT * 
FROM payments 
WHERE (amount <= 40000 OR amount >= 60000) 
AND paymentDate >= '2005-05-25';

üü¶ IN Operator
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE officeCode IN (1, 2, 4)
ORDER BY officeCode;
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE officeCode NOT IN (1, 2, 4)
ORDER BY officeCode;


üü© BETWEEN Operator

SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE creditLimit BETWEEN 20000 AND 40000;

üü® LIKE Operator

-- Starts with
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE firstName LIKE 'A%';

-- Ends with
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE firstName LIKE '%y';

-- 3rd letter is 'a'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE firstName LIKE '__a%';


üü• REGEXP Operator
Syntax	Meaning
^	Starts with
$	Ends with
`	`
-- Contains 'sale'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE jobTitle REGEXP 'sale';

-- Starts with 'sale'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE jobTitle REGEXP '^sale';

-- Ends with 'rep'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE jobTitle REGEXP 'rep$';

-- Starts with J or L
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE jobTitle REGEXP '^J|^L';

-- Starts with a-h or ends with 'lie'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE jobTitle REGEXP '^[a-h]|lie$';


üü¶ IS NULL Operator
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE comments IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE shippedDate IS NOT NULL;

üü© ORDER BY Clause
-- Descending sort
SELECT contactLastName, contactFirstName 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY city DESC;

-- Multiple fields
SELECT customerName, contactLastName, contactFirstName, city 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY city DESC, contactLastName;

üü® LIMIT Clause
-- Top N rows
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 5;

-- Skip N rows, then get M
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 5, 10;
üîÅ Querying Multiple Tables
INNER JOIN
SELECT t1.column1, t2.column2 
FROM table1 t1 
INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;

JOIN with Alias
SELECT o.orderNumber, o.status, o.customerNumber,
       e.firstName AS "Sales Person Name", e.jobTitle
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
JOIN employees e ON c.salesRepEmployeeNumber = e.employeeNumber;

üîÇ SELF JOIN
SELECT emp.employeeNumber, emp.firstName, emp.jobTitle,
       mgr.firstName AS "Manager Name", mgr.jobTitle AS "Manager Title"
FROM employees emp
JOIN employees mgr ON emp.reportsTo = mgr.employeeNumber;

üß© IMPLICIT JOIN (CROSS JOIN)
SELECT p.customerNumber, paymentDate, amount, customerName
FROM payments p, customers c
WHERE p.customerNumber = c.customerNumber;


üîÑ OUTER JOINs
1. INNER JOIN:
-- Only matched records from both tables
2. LEFT JOIN:
-- All records from left table, matched from right

3. RIGHT JOIN:
-- All records from right table, matched from left

4. FULL OUTER JOIN:
-- All records from both sides with NULLs where no match

üí° Venn Diagram Reference
Inner Join: Intersection

Left Join: Entire left table

Right Join: Entire right table

Full Join: Union of both tables

üîÅ SELF OUTER JOIN
Useful for hierarchies or incomplete data.
-- Similar to self join but ensures inclusion of all rows

üî§ USING Clause
SELECT * 
FROM orders 
JOIN customers 
USING (customerNumber);

üåê NATURAL JOIN:
SELECT orderNumber, customerNumber, customerName
FROM orders
NATURAL JOIN customers;


‚úÖ Summary
Use SELECT to fetch data

Use JOINs to combine multiple tables

Use WHERE, LIKE, REGEXP, BETWEEN for filtering

Use ORDER BY, LIMIT for sorting and pagination

Use IS NULL, IN, NOT IN, and Aliases to enhance readability

Use USING or NATURAL JOIN for simplified syntax

## üîÑ 16. What is a Trigger in SQL?

A **Trigger** is a stored procedure that automatically executes when an event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occurs in a table.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_customer
BEFORE INSERT ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
```

---

## üßæ 17. What is a View? (With Example)

SELECT customerName, creditLimit
FROM customers
WHERE creditLimit > 50000;
```

---

## üß© 18. What is Normalization? With Examples

Normalization is used to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

### 1NF (First Normal Form):

- Ensures atomic columns (no multiple values).

```text
Invalid: Skills = "Java, Python"
Valid: Separate rows for Java and Python
```

### 2NF (Second Normal Form):

- Removes partial dependency (only applicable for composite keys).

```text
Split employee_project into employee and project tables.
```

### 3NF (Third Normal Form):

- Removes transitive dependencies.

```text
Move department_name out of employees if stored redundantly.
```

---

Constraints enforce rules on columns.

- `NOT NULL`
- `UNIQUE`
- `CHECK`
- `DEFAULT`
- `PRIMARY KEY`
- `FOREIGN KEY`

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  age INT CHECK(age >= 18)
);
```

---

## üîê 20. What is a Transaction and COMMIT/ROLLBACK?

A **Transaction** is a group of SQL operations that are executed as a single unit.

- `COMMIT`: Saves changes
- `ROLLBACK`: Reverts changes

### Example:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

---

## ‚ö° 21. What is an Index? Explain Composite Index

An **Index** is used to speed up queries.

- **Composite Index**: Index on multiple columns.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name_dept ON employees(lastName, departmentId);
```

---

## üìÇ 22. Difference Between Temporary Table and View?

| Feature | Temporary Table | View |
|--------|------------------|------|
| Storage | Stored in temp memory | Virtual table |
| Lifetime | Exists for session | Persistent |
| Updatable | Yes | Sometimes, depending on SQL |

---

## üîÑ 23. What is a Cursor in SQL?

A **Cursor** is used to retrieve rows one at a time from the result set.

### Example:

```sql
DECLARE myCursor CURSOR FOR SELECT name FROM students;
OPEN myCursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM myCursor;
CLOSE myCursor;
```

---

## üìå 24. What is the difference between DDL, DML, and TCL?

- **DDL**: Data Definition Language (`CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`)
- **DML**: Data Manipulation Language (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- **TCL**: Transaction Control Language (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`)

---

## üîÅ 25. Explain WITH Clause / CTE (Common Table Expression)

CTE allows you to define a temporary result set that can be referred within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

### Example:

```sql
WITH high_salary AS (
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000
)
SELECT firstName FROM high_salary WHERE departmentId = 5;
```
