------------------- ALL KEYWORDS ----------------------------------------------------
 PROBLEMS:
       FIND PRODUCTS COSTLIER THAN ALL TRUCKS

select * from
 products where MSRP > ALL (
 select MSRP from products
  where productLine REGEXP 'TRUCK'
)

ALL returns true only if the comparison is true for every value in the subquery or list.
If the subquery returns no rows, ALL returns true (since the comparison holds for an empty set).
ALL is different from ANY or SOME, which mean "at least one".


EXAMPLE:
       SELECT * 
FROM Students 
WHERE Score >= ALL (SELECT Score FROM Students WHERE Class = 'B');


------------------ ANY KEYWORDS -------------------------------------------

The ANY keyword in SQL is used to compare a value to any value in a subquery or list
â€” it returns TRUE if the condition is true for at least one value in that set.
SELECT * 
FROM Products 
WHERE Price != ANY (10, 20, 30);

-------------- CORRELATED SUBQUERY -----------------------------------------
A correlated subquery is a subquery that depends on the outer query for its values. 
It is executed once for each row selected by the outer query.

A correlated subquery references a column from the outer query in its WHERE clause or SELECT clause.
SELECT column1
FROM table1 t1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM table2 t2
    WHERE t2.foreign_key = t1.primary_key
);


-------------- EXAMPLE 2 -----------------------------------------------
SELECT column1
FROM table1 t1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM table2 t2
    WHERE t2.foreign_key = t1.primary_key
);

---------------------------- EXISTS OPERATOR --------------------------------------
The EXISTS operator in SQL is used to test for the existence of rows returned by a subquery.
It returns TRUE if the subquery returns at least one row, and FALSE if the subquery returns no rows.
